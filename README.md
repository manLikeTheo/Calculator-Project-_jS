# Calculator-Project-_jS

This is the last project in "The Odin Project" Foundations course. Here we will set out to build a simple calculator, using HTML, CSS and javaScript

God Damn! This one tested my debugging skills but i got to learn the humility and patience required of a developer in solving complex tasks.

I also learned how to work with numbers and manipulate the DOM to run simple math operations.

Adding the keyboard functionality was a tricky one, especially getting my "Enter" key to stop acting like a jackass. In the end, "e.preventDefault()" fixed it. 

Looking to refactor and Optimize this code in the future and maybe add a couple more UI themes to the calculator. 

Thanks for putting this course together. You guys Rock!!!
